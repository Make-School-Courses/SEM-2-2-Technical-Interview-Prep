## Warm Up (30 min)

### Activity I

**Candy Sorting I**

After a successful night of trick-or-treating, you've got more candy than you need so you decide to create an algorithm to help you sort them. You plan to pass in a list of all of the candies you have, a list of your favorite candies, and the number of candy pieces you want to keep. Your algorithm should give back a list of the candy you'll keep, and a list of the candy you'll give away.

- Give students a few minutes to write down questions they have to clarify the prompt further.
- As a class, answer all clarification questions and create a sample input and output.
- Give students 10 minutes to start hand-writing their solution.
- Students pair and share for 10 minutes to discuss their strategies and further check their understanding of the prompt - focus on resolving any remaining abmiguities about how the algorithm should work.

## Work Out (45 min)

### Activity II

**Candy Sorting II**

After trick-or-treating with your younger sibling, your parents say you have to combine all of the candy and then divide it fairly between the two of you. They've also given a maximum amount of candy each of you is allowed to keep. Now your algorithm needs to take in the list of all the candy, your candy preferences, your siblings candy preferences, and the candy limit for how many each of you can keep. The outputs should now be a list of candy for you, a list of candy for your sibling, and a list of leftover candy (that your parents _said_ they were going to donate, but you know they are secretly keeping it for themselves).

- Regardless of if everyone fully solved the first prompt, the facilitator now introduces the updated prompt.
- As a class, take the time to reclarify the requirements and to update the sample inputs and outputs.
- Students move to the whiteboards to write new algorithms to address the updated prompt.
- Students are encouraged to continue sharing and checking their ideas with classmates.

## Wrap Up (5 min)

- Share/pair feedback on recent activity
- Highlight key takeaways
- Begin challenges

## Challenges (before next class)

### Journal Entry

- Without having to come up with exact solutions, can you reason about the different run times for solutions to each of the prompts above?
- Can you do the same for the space constraints?
- What are the worst-case scenarios for each?
- Are there changes to the inputs or outputs that would significantly reduce either the time or space complexity?

## Make Up (if absent or overly tardy)

### Research and Report

1. Speak to two peers who were in class about the activities that they did and how useful they found them to be.
2. Write a summary of your findings, highlighting areas where your peers either agreed or disagreed about their experience.

Be prepared to present a short 1-2 min summary at the start of the next class.
