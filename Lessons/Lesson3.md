- As a class, work through the first three questions of the example prompt
- Individuals write their first three answers to the next prompt on paper or a whiteboard.
- Pair and share answers with classmates and all agree which assumptions to use for that prompt.
- Individuals write out their solutions to the prompt given the selected assumptions on paper or a whiteboard.
- Pair and share solutions with classmates.
- Complete all prompts if time allows.

## Wrap Up (5 min)

- Share/pair feedback on recent activity
- Highlight key takeaways
- Begin challenges

## Make Up (if absent or overly tardy)

### Research and Report

1. Speak to two peers who were in class about the activities that they did and how useful they found them to be.
2. Write a summary of your findings, highlighting areas where your peers either agreed or disagreed about their experience.
