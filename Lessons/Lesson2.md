## Warm Up (20 min)

### Activity I

**Pair/Share**

Discuss your answers to the previous Journal Entry.

### Activity II

**Solve**

Write out a solution for FizzBuzz on paper.

## Work Out (50 min)

### Activity III

**Interview Loop Drill**

Groups of 3 take turns as Interviewee, Interviewer, and Observer to role play a technical interview. (Groups of 2 can perform the same activity without an Observer)

_Prep (5 min)_

- Group students and assign starting roles.
- Write out things to focus on for each role
- Group members agree about which language to use since they will all need to write it.
- Each group should have a whiteboard and a paper for the observer to take notes on.

_Practice (15 min)_

- Interviewees/interviewers role play a whiteboard technical interview to solve FizzBuzz.
- Every few minutes, the facilitator will say "Swap!" and then group members all rotate roles: Interviewer -> Interviewee -> Observer -> Interviewer
- Group members should shift places and immediately pick up where the solution left off.

_Review (5 min)_

- Halfway through the available time, facilitator stops the groups.
- Groups discuss the Observer notes and any other feedback they have for each other.

Practice 2 (15 min)

- After the review, erase existing code on the whiteboards.
- Repeat the practice phase, restarting from scratch with a focus on incorporating feedback and suggested improvements from the first review.

Review 2 (10 min)

- Groups review their performance again.
- Entire class should view and discuss whiteboard solutions of other groups as well if time allows.

## Wrap Up (10 min)

- Share/pair feedback on recent activity
- Highlight key takeaways
- Begin challenges

## Challenges (before next class)

### 1 - Form Submission
Go to [make.sc/sem22-form](make.sc/sem22-form)

1. For Question 1: Submit your journal entry from lesson 1 challenges.
2. For Question 2: Compare and contrast the different experiences of doing an in-person whiteboard interview vs. a remote online computer-based interview. Which seems more or less challenging for you, and why?
3. Optionally provide feedback on your class experience so far. Just like we all need good honest feedback to help us level up our interviewing skills, your honest feedback helps to ensure this class is as useful for everyone as possible.

### 2 - Journal Entry

_All journal entries are for your own reflection on the topic, and are not turned in on a regular basis. However, you must be prepared to pull up your journal entry in class in order to summarize your answer and/or engage in class discussion about it._

**Part 1**

Read: [FizzBuzz in Too Much Detail](https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-design/fizzbuzz-in-too-much-detail/)

1. From the article, list out the key changes and reasons the author gives for his evolving implementations of his FizzBuzz solution.
2. Generalizing from that list, create an acronym or other memory aid that you can use to help you think through your code design choices/options in an interview.

**Part 2**

Watch: [How to: Work at Google â€” Example Coding/Engineering Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw)

1. From the video, list out the interviewing best practices that were demonstrated and discussed.
2. Generalizing from that list, create another acronym or other memory aid that you can use to help you think through your code design choices in an interview.

_In order to allow everyone time to come up with their own acronyms without bias, please do not share or discuss your answer with others in the class. We will pair and share in the next class._

### Bonus (Optional)

Get a group together and do more Interview Loop practice.

## Make Up (if absent or overly tardy)

### Research and Report

1. Speak to two peers who were in class about the activities that they did and how useful they found them to be.
2. Write a summary of your findings, highlighting areas where your peers either agreed or disagreed about their experience.

Be prepared to present a short 1-2 min summary at the start of the next class.
