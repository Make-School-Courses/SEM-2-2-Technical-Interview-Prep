## Warm Up (25 min)

### Activity I

**Business Card Exchange Drill**

Fill out a notecard with:
- Your name
- The company you hope to work for 1 year from now
- The job title you hope to have 1 year from now

Everyone stands up and practices mingling at a networking event.

Each time you meet a new person, be sure to introduce yourself according to the business card you made for yourself, and then exchange business cards. (You won't have your own card after the first time, that's okay, just pretend as if the one you have is always yours.)

Your goal is to exchange business cards with as many people as possible while also realistically role playing the introduction (ie. no quick "Hi, have my business card").

### Teacher Talk

The goal of the facilitator is to maximize in-class time for hands-on practice of skills and techniques.

Think of this seminar like a team practice for you and your peers who are all training to perform at an elite level in the sport of technical interviewing. Everyone is expected to be 100% present, focused, and participatory when in the classroom.

You would not be allowed to multitask on other things in a technical interview and you will not be allowed to do so in this class.

### Activity II

**Write/Pair/Share**

1. Which aspects of the technical interview process are you most worried about succeeding in?
2. Which do you feel most confident about?

## Work Out (45 min)

### Activity III

**Technical Interview Rubric Self-assessment**

- Rate yourself in each row for how well you think you would do if you were asked to take a technical interview right this minute.
- Underline the words that led you to give yourself that rating

### Activity IV

**Whiteboard Communication Drill**

- Pair up and take turns as interviewer/interviewee
- Instead of algorithms, interviewees are given a list of 3-5 things to draw on the whiteboard
- Focus on communicating your thought process out-loud as you work
- Switch roles every 5 min and use new requirements each time

Example requirements:<br>
The first 3 are given at the start and the interviewer should give the last 2 after interviewee has started drawing, in order to simulate getting additional requirements during a technical interview.

1. 2 buildings
2. water
3. some animals
4. a container
5. a hat

## Wrap Up (10 min)

- Share/pair feedback on recent activity
- Highlight key takeaways
- Begin challenges

### Additional Resources

## Challenges (before next class)

### Journal Entry

_All journal entries are for your own reflection on the topic, and are not turned in on a regular basis. However, you must be prepared to pull up your journal entry in class in order to summarize your answer and/or engage in class discussion about it._

1. What are the technical interview areas you feel weakest in?
2. Choose one skill or technique to focus on first - brainstorm some ideas for how you could practice just that one skill. Feel free to list resources online that you could utilize.

## Make Up (if absent or overly tardy)

### Research and Report

1. Speak to two peers who were in class about the activities that they did and how useful they found them to be.
2. Write a summary of your findings, highlighting areas where your peers either agreed or disagreed about their experience.

Be prepared to present a short 1-2 min summary at the start of the next class.
