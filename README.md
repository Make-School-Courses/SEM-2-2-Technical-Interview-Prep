## Class Assignments
All in-class and take-home assignments are geared towards identifying and then putting into practice key skills and techniques for mastering technical interviews.

### Tutorials
TBD

### Projects
TBD

### Other assignments

- Technical interview drills, full-length and partial
- Reading and review of useful techniques and skills
- Self-reflection to identify personal areas for improvement
- Hand-written algorithm writing, testing, and complexity evaluation

## Evaluation

To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
- Make up all classwork from all absences
- Complete 4 full-length practice technical interviews with graded rubric feedback

## Attendance
In-class time is inspired by the sports team analogy: peer activities are the key to practicing technique and improving skills. Due to the hands-on drill and practice of each class, when people decide not to show up on a regular basis, they are also at risk of harming the learning effectiveness for the class as a whole.

Please treat each class as if it's a scheduled interview with a company that you would be excited to work for and proactively communicate any absence in advance.

```js
shouldISkipClass(reason) {
  return shouldISkipMyInterview(reason);
}

shouldISkipMyInterview(reason) {
  // returns true if reason is so compelling it's worth canceling or rescheduling your interview
  // otherwise, return false
}
```

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:

- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan). Failure to improve after the PIP will result in not being invited back next term.
